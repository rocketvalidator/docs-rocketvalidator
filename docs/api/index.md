# Rocket Validator API

!!! info "Work in progress!"
    The Rocket Validator API is currently in alpha stage, and subject to changes.

Welcome to the Rocket Validator API documentation.

The Rocket Validator API allows you to manage your reports and integrate them easily in your existing workflows using conventional HTTP requests to a standard JSON API. Refer to the <a href="https://jsonapi.org/" target="_blank">json:api specification</a> for an overview of the conventions we use.

Currently the API is on an alpha stage, but you can start using it today. Keep in mind that it is still subject to changes, which will be documented on the changelog.
