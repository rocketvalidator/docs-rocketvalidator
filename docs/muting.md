# Muting Issues

When validating your sites, you may find that some of the issues won't be currently fixed, for example:

* The affected code is out of your scope, for example it's being generated by a 3rd party software that you cannot control.
* You may be aware of an issue, but you've evaluated it and prefer to let it exist for some reason.
* You've decided that this will be fixed later and prefer to concentrate on other issues first.

In those situations, <a href="/pricing/pro">Pro users</a> can avoid all the noise related to those selected issues by <i>muting</i> them.

## How to mute issues

The simplest way to mute an issue is directly on an issue list. Just hover over an issue and you'll see a `MUTE` button.

When you click that button, you'll be on the new muting rule form:

Then click on "Submit" and your new muting rule will be created and applied to your reports.
