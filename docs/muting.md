# Muting Issues

When validating your sites, you may find that some of the issues won't be currently fixed, for example:

* The affected code is out of your scope, for example it's being generated by a 3rd party software that you cannot control.
* You may be aware of an issue, but you've evaluated it and prefer to let it exist for some reason.
* You've decided that this will be fixed later and prefer to concentrate on other issues first.

In those situations, <a href="https://rocketvalidator.com/pricing/pro">Pro users</a> can avoid all the noise related to those selected issues by <i>muting</i> them.

## How to mute issues

The simplest way to mute an issue is directly on an issue list. Just click the `MUTE` button.

When you do that, you'll be taken to the new muting rule form:

Then click on "Submit" and your new muting rule will be created and applied to the current and next reports.

## Muting options

To define a muting rule you need to specify:

* **Matching URL**. The muting rule will be applied to URLs containing this string. Try to be as specific as possible to limit the scope of this rule.
* **Message**. Enter the matching message here. Try to be as specific as possible to limit the scope of this muting rule.
* **Comment / explanation**. Optional but recommended, so you can explain why you decided to mute this rule.
