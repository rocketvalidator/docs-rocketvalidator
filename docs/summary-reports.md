# Summary Reports

Chances are the issues found on your validates sites affect many of their web pages, but in reality it's the same issue
over and over again. In many cases, the affected code lies within a layout or shared template, so fixing it once removes this issue from hundreds or thousands of pages at once.

To help you understand the big picture, Rocket Validator gives you a summary report that groups together all the HTML issues found. To see it, just click on the *HTML issues* or *A11Y issues* tab:
