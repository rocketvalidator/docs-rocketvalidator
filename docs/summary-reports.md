# Summary Reports

Chances are that the issues found on your sites affect many of their web pages, but in reality it's the same issue over and over again. In many cases, the affected code lies within a layout or a shared template, so fixing it once will remove this issue from hundreds or thousands of pages at once.

## HTML / A11Y issues tab

To help you understand the big picture, Rocket Validator gives you a summary report that groups together all the HTML issues found. To see it, just click on the *HTML issues* or *A11Y issues* tab:

On this report, you'll see all the issues found in all the web pages, grouped together and ordered by their frequency. For each issue, you can see how many web pages are affected by it.

The grouped issues are ordered by their severity and the number of web pages that it affects, so you can concentrate on fixing the most important issues first.
