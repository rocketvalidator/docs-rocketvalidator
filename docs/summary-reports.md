# Summary Reports

Chances are that the issues found on your sites affect many of their web pages, but in reality it's the same issue over and over again.

In many cases, the affected code lies within a layout or a shared template, so fixing it once will remove this issue from hundreds or thousands of pages at once.

That's why the first screen you'll see when creating a new report is the **Summary**. This screen shows the main HTML and accessibility issues found on your checked site, grouped by their importance. You'll get a highlight of the first 3 issues for each kind of check so you can focus on fixing them first, and a link to see the full list of issues.

Also, for the HTML and accessibility checks, a **progress gauge** shows the percentage of pages that passed all the checks. Your goal is to reach a 100% of web pages passing all checks.

## Common HTML / accessibility issues tabs

The Summary screen gives you the main 3 issues for each kind of check. If you want to get the full list of issues, you can use the Common HTML issues or the Common accessibility issues tabs.

On the common issues reports you'll see all the issues found in all the web pages, grouped together and ordered by their frequency. For each issue, you can see how many web pages are affected by it.

The grouped issues are ordered by their severity and the number of web pages that it affects, so you can concentrate on fixing the most important issues first.
