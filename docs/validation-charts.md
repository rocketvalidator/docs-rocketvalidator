# Validation Charts

Site validations include history charts that show the evolution of the monitored sites over time. This lets you quickly see how you're doing in fixing the issues found, or check if new issues have been introduced.

## Page status chart

This chart categorizes the validated pages in your site by its overall status: no issues, only warnings, pages with errors, or pages that could not be validated (404s, 500s, etc.).
