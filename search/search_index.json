Sometimes, this process that is called \"scraping\" fails, and it can be due to a number of reasons. Here are the most typical ones:</p> Authorization required Sites must be publicly accessible to be validated. Could not be found (404) The URL you provided could not be found. Connection timed out The site is taking too long to respond. Retry again later, when the remote server has less traffic. Too many requests to remote server The remote server is denying us access because it is rate limiting us. Contact your sys admin to relax this rate limiting, or try again later. Blocked The remote server is blocking our requests. Consult the User Agents page to explicitly allow our requests. No internal links found The document returned for the starting URL contains no links, or the links are not on the same host.
