Rocket Validator speed depends on the speed at which your validated server can respond. To avoid clogging your servers, we rate limit our validations to 5 simultaneous connections, so the faster your server respond, the faster we can validate it. Why can't some sites be scraped? When you submit an URL for validation, we send a web spider to visit the site and get its links. Sometimes, this process that is called \"scraping\" fails, and it can be due to a number of reasons. Here are the most typical ones: Authorization required Sites must be publicly accessible to be validated. Could not be found (404) The URL you provided could not be found. Connection timed out The site is taking too long to respond. Retry again later, when the remote server has less traffic. Too many requests to remote server The remote server is denying us access because it is rate limiting us. Contact your sys admin to relax this rate limiting, or try again later. Blocked The remote server is blocking our requests. Consult the User Agents page to explicitly allow our requests. No internal links found The document returned for the starting URL contains no links, or the links are not on the same host. The spider will only follow internal links from the starting URL. If none of this explains the reason why your site is not being scraped, contact us and we'll help you find the cause. Can I validate pages that require authorization? No, there is no direct way of validating pages that require login. Rocket Validator is a distributed system with different internal pieces: our own web crawler, the HTML validator and the A11Y validator. Requests to your web pages come from these three different origins, so authentication handling would need to be implemented in all of them, and would need to cover the different authentication systems most web sites implement. Instead, we recommend other approaches to checking protected sites: You can validate your local development server directly . This also makes it faster to fix the issues, as you don\u2019t need to deploy them. You can have a separate server that doesn\u2019t need authentication. You can have a copy of the templates for the restricted pages in a different directory that doesn't require authentication. Does Rocket Validator cache pages? No, we don't use any kind of cache neither on the link scraper, nor on the validator. If you're changing your page and you're getting the same validation results, the possible reason can be: Your server is using cache, like for example Varnish . Your pages are being rendered depending on the User-Agent string - you might be seeing your changes on the browser, but your server might be serving different content to the validator. The default User-Agent string for the validator is Validator.nu/LV http://validator.w3.org/services How long are reports stored? We store the results of your validations for a limited time, depending on your subscription plan. See the pricing table. Can I share reports with other people? Sure, you can share your validation reports with anyone. Just use one of the buttons at the bottom of the summary and you'll be able to send anyone the URL of the report. They'll be able to see the validation results just like you - but they won't be able to re-check any page or modify anything, only you can control this. Can I export reports to Excel, CSV, or PDF? No, reports can't be exported to these formats, because the generated file would be too heavy to handle. Think of a large site with 3,000 validated web pages, where each page has 100 issues. The result would be a file containing 300,000 rows - this is not something you'll easily handle in Excel or that you'd be wanting to read as a PDF. Instead, our web interface lets you easily browse all the web pages and its issues, re-check each page as needed, and share the reports with your colleagues or clients. How can I exclude Rocket Validator from Google Analytics traffic?

The first two will just get the static HTML content, but the Accessibility Checker behaves like a real browser (using Headless Chrome), so it's going to execute JavaScript in the visited pages - and that includes the Google Analytics script, if it's there. So, it's perfectly normal to see a spike in the Google Analytics traffic when you're validating a site. But in most cases, you can prefer to exclude this traffic from the stats. There are 2 options to do that, let's explore them. Not rendering the Google Analytics script This option may be the simpler method, if your web site can detect the User Agent string from the request. It may not be an option in certain cases like static sites. If you can do that, then it's simple: in case the User Agent string contains RocketValidator , don't include the script that triggers Google Analytics. However, we don't recommend this option as it's preferable to not customize your content based on User Agents, so the bots can have \"the real thing\". Let's say a script introduces an accessibility issue, you're not going to detect it if you hide it from the bots. Filtering out from Google Analytics The second option requires a bit more work to set up but it's cleaner. There's nothing to set up on your server and the content stays the same. What you need to to instead is tell Google Analytics to filter out requests depending on the User Agent string. Setting up Google Analytics via Google Tag Manager First step is having Google Analytics installed via the Google Tag Manager. This way, it's easy to extend it with custom dimensions, like the User Agent. Follow this guide: Deploy Google Analytics with Tag Manager . Create a custom dimension for User Agent Next, go to your Google Analytics admin panel. Click on \"Custom Definitions\" in the \"Property\" column, and select \"Custom Dimensions\". Create a new Custom Dimension with the name \"User Agent\". Write down the \"Index\" value for the created Custom Dimension as we'll need it later. Create a variable in Google Tag Manager Now, go to your Google Tag Manager account and click on \"Variables\" on the left-hand side menu. Click on \"New\" under \"User-Defined Variables\". Set the name as \"User Agent\", the Variable Type as \"JavaScript Variable\" and the Global Variable Name as navigator.userAgent . Click on \"Save\". This will set up a JavaScript variable that will store the User Agent string, so it can be passed to Google Analytics. Define a custom dimension in Google Analytics Settings Still on the Google Tag Manager Variables section, click on the Google Analytics Settings variable: Edit the tag settings, open \"Custom Dimensions\" and click on \"Add Custom Dimension\". Set the index to the index matching the custom dimension in your Google Analytics account. Set the Dimension Value to {{User Agent}} . This will pass the User Agent to Google Analytics. Remember to Publish your changes in Google Tag Manager so they're enabled. Create a filter in Google Analytics The last step is going back to your Google Analytics account, Admin section. Click on \"Filters\" on the \"View\" column. Click on \"Add Filter\". Set the Filter Name as \"User-Agent RocketValidator\". Choose \"Custom\" in Filter Type. In the Exclude option, select the field \"User-Agent\" on the Custom Dimensions. And, in Filter Pattern, use this regular expression: .*RocketValidator.* . And that's it! It may take some time for the filter to take effect (but in most cases it's just a matter of minutes). This method does not remove traffic retroactively - it can only filter out traffic happening after the creation of the filter.","title":"Google Analytics"},{"location":"google-analytics/#excluding-rocket-validator-bots-from-google-analytics-traffic","text":"As explained in the User Agents section, when you validate a site with Rocket Validator, your server will be visited by 3 different systems: Link Spider, HTML Checker and Accessibility Checker.

Your guests will be able to sign up for free, no credit card required, but still run HTML and Accessibility validation reports, set up schedules, define muting rules and use the API, on their own accounts. Their usage will be substracted from your main account credits, up to the limit you define. As a host, you can supervise your guests' activity. You can see the reports your guests generate, and have your domain stats up to date with the data from your guests' reports. You control how many credits they can use per month, and can cancel or adjust at any time. The Guest Accounts feature is only available for users with a Pro or Enterprise subscription. With each Pro subscription, you get 5 guest accounts, which are designed for small and medium-sized organizations. For larger organizations, you can subscribe to the Enterprise plan , which gives you 100 guest accounts per subscription. If you need more than that you can just subscribe to additional packages. Creating your Guest Accounts invitations The first step for having your guest accounts set up is creating the invitation tokens. To do that, go to the Guests section and click on the Invite Guests button: Then, fill in the form to specify how many invitations to create, and how many allowed credits per month will be allowed for each invitation. In the next screenshot you can see how we create 5 invitations, with 5,000 allowed monthly credits each: Sharing your Guest Accounts invitations Once you have created the invitations, you'll see the list of available invitations. Each invitation has a unique token - think of it like a coupon code, a voucher or a gift card, that you can share with anyone so that they can create an account for free. Click on any of the invitations and you'll see a preview of the invitation, as your guests will see it. At the bottom you'll find the instructions to share the invitation (basically you just need to pass them the URL). You can also download the invitation list as a CSV file by clicking on the Download Guest List button. This can be useful to keep track of who has been assigned to each invitation. Checking your guest activity You'll be notified by email once your guests accept the invitation. At that point, they'll be able to run their own reports, and you can see their activity by clicking on their name in the Guests section: On this screen you'll find: Your guest's token .

If you do so, we won't need to crawl your site to discover the pages to validate, so we can start validating pages sooner. You can read about the XML sitemaps protocol here , but in short, all you need is to specify each URL in this format: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <urlset xmlns= \"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\" > <url> <loc> http://example.com/page1 </loc> </url> <url> <loc> http://example.com/page2 </loc> </url> <url> <loc> http://example.com/page3 </loc> </url> </urlset> You can generate this XML sitemap manually or by using a tool like this one . Remember to serve the XML sitemap with a content-type of text/xml . See for example our XML sitemap at https://rocketvalidator.com/sitemap.xml . Once you have your sitemap ready and within your site, you can just submit it to Rocket Validator as the starting URL. For example, instead of submitting http://validationhell.com you'd submit http://validationhell.com/sitemap.xml . Using XML sitemaps leads to much faster site crawlings, and also lets you be more organized when validating large sites. For example, you can use different XML sitemaps for the different sections in a large site. Using a plain text sitemap If your site doesn't have an XML sitemap, a simpler alternative is building a plain text sitemap. This is just a text file with all the URLs to include, one per line. Remember to serve your plain text sitemap with a content-type of text/plain . See for example our plain text sitemap https://rocketvalidator.com/sitemap.txt . Validating a smaller set of pages While it's tempting to try to validate sites in its entirety, in most cases that's unnecessary. For example, the New York Times site has over 15 million URLs, it would be impossible to validate the whole site. When you have a blog, or an online store, your site has easily thousands of pages, but most of them are using the same layout. Instead of validating each of them, consider building an XML sitemap with a sample of each different kind of page.

There's a limit on the pages included depending on your subscription plan, but you'll typically want to set a much lower limit. If you need to validate more pages than the limit on a report, consider using XML sitemaps to organize pages into sets. Validation speed (requests/second) . By default is 3 reqs/second, can be set higher depending on your subscription plan. Read more . Deep Crawling . When enabled, our crawler will recursively look for more internal web pages following the links found. Validate HTML and Accessibility or only HTML . Choose if you want to include A11Y checks on top of HTML checks. Device Viewport Emulation . Optionally choose a device to emulate while validating the page for accessibility issues. This will set the viewport's width, height and device scale factor to the ones in the selected device. If none selected, the default 800x600 viewport will be used. Active . Disable this to temporarily pause the scheduled validation.

You'll get a highlight of the main issues for each kind of check so you can focus on fixing them first, and a link to see the full lists of HTML and accessibility issues. Also, for the HTML and accessibility checks, a progress bar shows the percentage of pages that passed all the checks. Your goal is to reach a 100% of web pages passing all checks.

If you want to get the full list of issues, you can use the Common HTML issues or the Common accessibility issues tabs. On the common issues reports you'll see all the issues found in all the web pages, grouped together and ordered by their frequency. For each issue, you can see how many web pages are affected by it. The grouped issues are ordered by their severity and the number of web pages that it affects, so you can concentrate on fixing the most important issues first.

Report A Report represents a validation report you've created in Rocket Validator. Contains a list of web pages that were found from the starting url, and the HTML and accessibility issues that were found. Web Page A Web Page represents an HTML web page that has been found by the scraper, and is associated to a Report. Accessibility Issue An Accessibility Issue corresponds to an issue found on a given web page when being checked by the A11Y checker. HTML Issue An HTML issue corresponds to an issue found on a given web page when being checked by the HTML validator. Common Accessibility Issue Typically, the same kind of issue affects many Web Pages on a given Report. For example, the issue \"Form elements must have labels\" may affect many Web Pages on the same report. A Common Accessibility Issue represents a given Accessibility Issue that is common to many Web Pages, thus showing its details, how many times it's found on the Report, and links to the related Web Pages. Common HTML Issue Typically, the same kind of issue affects many Web Pages on a given Report. For example, the issue \"The \u201ccenter\u201d element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.\" may affect many Web Pages on the same report. A Common HTML Issue represents a given HTML Issue that is common to many Web Pages, thus showing its details, how many times it's found on the Report, and links to the related Web Pages.

Example: PATCH https://rocketvalidator.com/api/v0/schedules/$SCHEDULE_ID { \"data\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"starting_url\" : \"http://validationhell.com\" , \"max_pages\" : 100 , \"rate_limit\" : 3 , \"perform_html_checks\" : true , \"perform_a11y_checks\" : true , \"deep_crawl\" : true , \"active\" : true , \"periodicity\" : { \"every\" : \"month\" , \"monthday\" : 15 } } } } You only need to include the attributes you want to update.
